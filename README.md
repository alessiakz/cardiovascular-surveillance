# Surveillance of Cardiovascular Mortality in the United States Dashboard (2000-2020)

This is an exploratory data analysis project investigating the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance Data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive report of tables and graphs that investigate the results of this table - including overall and geospatial analyses.

The data was obtained from the CDC's website [here](https://data.cdc.gov/Heart-Disease-Stroke-Prevention/National-Vital-Statistics-System-NVSS-National-Car/kztq-p2jf/about_data).
